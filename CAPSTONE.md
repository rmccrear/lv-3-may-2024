# Capstone Project: Web App with API Integration, Authentication, and RESTful Routes

## Requirements

- [ ] Wireframes: Create wireframes for your web app, including the main components and layout. This includes components and their hierarchy and data flow. (Use this when you plan out your components and create stories in StoryBook.)
- [ ] Readme: Create a `README.md` file that explains your project. This should include a description of your project, how to run it, and how to test it. (In some ways, this is the most important part of your project. It is the first thing people will see when they visit your project.)
- [ ] At least 3 pages: Create at least 3 pages for your web app. This should include a home page, a page for your API integration and an about page. (You can add more pages if you like.)
- [ ] Components: Create components for your web app. This should include at least 5 components. (You can add more components if you like.)
- [ ] Test tools: Use StoryBook to test at least 3 of your components. (I recommend you test ALL your components. You will thank yourself later.) (Bonus if you use Jest and React Testing Library, too)
- [ ] Thoughtful design: Use Tailwind CSS or another CSS Framework (like Bootstrap) to style your web app. (Bonus if you use a CSS framework like Daisy UI or shadcn/ui.)
- [ ] API Integration: Integrate an API into your project. This should be an API that requires and API key hidden behind a proxy server. Create at least 2 routes in the `/api` folder in your Next.js project.
- [ ] Services: Your web app should have at least one service that fetches data from the API and passes it to your components. It should also be able to send an email to you when a user submits a form.
- [ ] .env file: Use a `.env.local` file to store your API key and other sensitive information. Make a `.env.local.example` file to show what keys are needed to run your app. (Don't put the actual keys in the example file!)
- [ ] Authentication: (optional) Implement Magic Link email authentication in your project.
- [ ] Persistent Data: Use a database to store data in your project. We will use upstash with Vercel to store data. The data should come from the user and be stored in the database. Examples include favorites, likes, comments, etc. (upstash is a Redis database that is free to use with Vercel.)
- [ ] RESTful Routes (optional): Implement RESTful routes in your project. This should include at least one route for each CRUD operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete). (Try for Create and Read, at least. Then add Update and Delete if you have time.)
- Deploy your web app to a hosting platform like Vercel or Netlify. Make sure your deployment is successful and your app is accessible online. Remember to include a link to your deployed app in your README.
