**Server Project Assignment**

In the Server Project Assignment, you will build a server capable of sending emails, storing user data like "likes," and implementing a "magic link" login system. This project is divided into three parts. In Part 1, you will use Resend to integrate email notifications into your server by setting up an endpoint to send emails. In Part 2, you will add data persistence to your server using Upstash, including storing messages and incrementing counters. Part 3 combines these features to create a fully functioning server that can send emails and store the data received from users. By the end, you will have a foundational understanding of server-side API development, email integration, and data storage with a NoSQL database. Reflecting on your process and documenting your architecture with diagrams is an essential part of this assignment. [ link ](week-6/assignment-1.md)


**Next.js Client Project Assignment**

The Next.js Client Project Assignment involves building a client-side application that interacts with your previously built server-side API. You will create a page using Next.js, allowing users to send messages through a form, and use hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage and display data. In Part 1, you will create a `contact-me` page to fetch and display data from your server. Part 2 introduces a form that lets users submit messages, which are stored in Upstash and also trigger email notifications. In Part 3, you will optionally create a page to list all the messages received using `useEffect` for data fetching. Lastly, Part 4 involves adding enhancements for user experience, such as form success feedback and basic CSS styling. You will reflect on the technical challenges and learning outcomes in the README.

**Magic Link Authentication Assignment**

The Magic Link Authentication Assignment builds on the server project by implementing a simple authentication system using magic links. The assignment starts by creating an endpoint to generate unique tokens for users, which are sent as magic links via email. Once clicked, these links authenticate users by verifying the token using Upstash. This part of the project aims to build a secure login system without the traditional password approach. The next step involves creating a `validate-token` endpoint to check the token's validity, after which a session token is generated. You will also protect certain endpoints using these session tokens to ensure that only authenticated users can access sensitive data. Finally, you will reflect on your process, documenting the flow of authentication and detailing the architecture of the magic link system in your README. This assignment gives you practical experience with modern, secure login techniques, session management, and API endpoint protection. [ link ](week-6/assignment-3.md)
